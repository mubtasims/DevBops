# DevBops

DevBops is an online social platform where developers from all around the world come together to work and socialize collectively. A platform where engineers can speak about their current projects, collab, sign up and browse events, and gain further knowledge on current projects that are in construction and deployed all around the world.

Currently, the project is working alongside AWS and other DevOps tools in order to deliver a strong and consistent app to the client. The app consists of a frontend where Flask alongside Python, HTML, CSS is used to structure the layout and what the users actually looks and interacts with. The frontend is then further connected to the API Gateway which acts as a bridge between the frontend and the backend microservices. The backend consists of codes written in Python alongside 3 microservices which are User, Events, and Blog. A well secured database is also running on DynamoDB, a database service of AWS, that is connected as the main data storage for the whole project. Alongside that, Jenkins pipeline is used to create a continuous integration of the tests that has been carried out by the QA team which is written in Python by using modules like unittest, pytest, alongside Postman.
